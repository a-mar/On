### myapalike.bst ###
This was an edit of the [apalike.bst](http://ftp.cs.stanford.edu/tex/bibtex/apalike.bst) file to look like [Plant Physiology](http://www.plantphysiol.org/) referencing ouput. The `.bib` file accompanying this referencing style should have the `number = {}` empty for `@article` types.






### Licence or disclaimer ###

The whole bunch of codes is distributed under the [MIT Licence](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) which means, as far as my poor understanding allows it:

The codes here are provided free of charge with no strings attached whatsoever&mdash;one can tweak and revise and even pass it on as theirs to their heart's content&mdash;BUT I'm not liable for any error whatsoever, ergo, don't blame me if it does not work. As it stands, the whole thing is buggy, and one can clean it up if they wish to&mdash;that would be more awesome in fact.

Enjoy. &#9786;
